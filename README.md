## Overview

​
## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Javascript
- npm modules
- Terminal and node
​
### What I learned
​
Upon fixing up this challenge it was nice to go through with the knowledge and more familiarity I have now to implement while still using only technology we learned up until the point of this section.
​
### Continued development
​
There are still a few spots that I would like to touch up, especially one the generateMarkdown.js file. So far I could only get the badges for the MIT license to show up, which currently is because of the return after every if statement but could not get it to work at all without it. Also the comments from the last submission mentioned I could just pass data into my generateMarkdown function and then reference them with dot notation but it either did not show up correctly or caused an error when trying.
​
### Useful resources
​
- [node/require resource](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/requiring-modules-in-node-js-everything-you-need-to-know-e7fbd119be8/) - Helpful super in depth reminder for using require
- [inquirer rescourse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) - excellent breakdown for the whole inquirer process
- [rendering badges resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) - This really helped with rendering the licenses and badges
- [If/else resource](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-if-else-and-if-then-js-conditional-statements/) - a little reminder of the options for if else statements

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the TAs on this one especially in hindsight. Both that helped me in longer capacities made comments that I was doing too much with the functions I originally had and one even mentioned I could get away with just one which caused me to find ways to slim it down a lot. Also the grader from the first submission provided some excellent feedback and even though I could could not immpliment all of the tips it has given me some ideas to look into.
