​
### What I learned
​
It is a little late in the course but I have learned that I have to compartmentalize a lot better, I felt really good through most of the beginning of this challenge but slowly got overwhelmed and confused when things would not work. A lot of that was due to jumping around and working on different parts of the code that impacted other sections and probably was my downfall.
​
### Continued development
​
Pretty much all of this. I made a seperate file called oldindex.js that was from a previous commit. I had gotten the prompt to show up in node and even create a mockREADME.md file but the prompt results would not show up. The newer index.js file looked like it was going to give me better results but ultimately could not stitch it together like the oldindex. I have left a lot of commented out code as reference of some of the thing I have tried so when I come back to this preject I'll know what not to do when revising. Which will be soon...
​
### Useful resources
​
- [node/require resource](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/requiring-modules-in-node-js-everything-you-need-to-know-e7fbd119be8/) - Helpful super in depth reminder for using require
- [inquirer rescourse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) - excellent breakdown for the whole inquirer process
- [rendering badges resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) - This really helped with rendering the licenses and badges
